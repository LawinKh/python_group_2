re.search is a function found in Python's re module which can be used when working with regular expressions (REGEX).
re.search looks through a string and stops at the first match it finds (W3school, RegEx). Accessed 25 May 2025

# Password generator function (optional) 
def generate_password(length):
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation #See explanation below
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for i in range(length)) #"See explanation below
    return password

'''
"string.ascii_letters" contains the combination of all lowercase and uppercase letters (a-z, A-Z). On the other hand,
"string.digits" includes collection of all the numbers (0-9). Also, "string.punctuation" contains the collection of all
special characters (!@#$%^&*, etc.). Overall, this creates a big pool of all characters that can be used in the
password. Source: Python.org, string â€” Common string operations, String constants. Accessed: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html
'''

'''
The string method ".join(...)" joins all the randomly chosen characters into a single string which is the password in
this case. We have empty string before .join so that there is no empty space between characters. In addition, "random.choice(characters)" selects one random character from the pool. The "for i in
range(length)" is a loop that repeats the process of character selection based on the password length inserted by the user.
